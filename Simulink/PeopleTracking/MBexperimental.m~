function filter = initBboxFilter(Detection)
% Step 1: Define the motion model and state.
%   Use a constant velocity model for a bounding box on the image.
%   The state is [x; vx; y; vy; w; wv; h; hv]
%   The state transition matrix is: 
%       [1 dt 0  0 0  0 0  0;
%        0  1 0  0 0  0 0  0; 
%        0  0 1 dt 0  0 0  0; 
%        0  0 0  1 0  0 0  0; 
%        0  0 0  0 1 dt 0  0; 
%        0  0 0  0 0  1 0  0;
%        0  0 0  0 0  0 1 dt; 
%        0  0 0  0 0  0 0  1]
%   Assume dt = 1. This example does not consider time-variant transition
%   model for linear Kalman filter.
    dt = 2;
    cvel =[1 dt; 0 1];
    A = blkdiag(cvel, cvel, cvel, cvel);
 
% Step 2: Define the process noise. 
%   The process noise represents the parts of the process that the model
%   does not take into account. For example, in a constant velocity model,
%   the acceleration is neglected.
    G1d = [dt^2/2; dt];
    Q1d = G1d*G1d';
    Q = blkdiag(Q1d, Q1d, Q1d, Q1d);
 
% Step 3: Define the measurement model.
%   Only the position ([x;y;w;h]) is measured.
%   The measurement model is
    H = [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; ...
         0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0; ...
         0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0; ...
         0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0];
 
% Step 4: Map the sensor measurements to an initial state vector.
%   Because there is no measurement of the velocity, the v components are
%   initialized to 0:
    state = [Detection.Measurement(1); ...
             0; ...
             Detection.Measurement(2); ...
             0; ...
             Detection.Measurement(3); ...
             0; ...
             Detection.Measurement(4); ...
             0];
 
% Step 5: Map the sensor measurement noise to a state covariance.
%   For the parts of the state that the sensor measured directly, use the
%   corresponding measurement noise components. For the parts that the
%   sensor does not measure, assume a large initial state covariance. That way,
%   future detections can be assigned to the track.
    L = 100; % Large value
    stateCov = diag([Detection.MeasurementNoise(1,1), ...
                     L, ...
                     Detection.MeasurementNoise(2,2), ...
                     L, ...

                     Detection.MeasurementNoise(4,4), ...
                     L]);
 
% Step 6: Create the correct filter.
%   In this example, all the models are linear, so use trackingKF as the
%   tracking filter.
    filter = trackingKF(...
        'StateTransitionModel', A, ...
        'MeasurementModel', H, ...
        'State', state, ...
        'StateCovariance', stateCov, ...
